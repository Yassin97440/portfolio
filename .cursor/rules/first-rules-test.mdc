# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

- when developing a front page, cut out the components in blocks. 
- Components should be located in the “components” folder and structured according to where they are displayed (for example: if you're making a page that's in lab, you'll make components in the “components/lab” folder).
- Check whether a component exists for the requirement. If a page already exists, but some of the details don't fit, adapt the component to make it more generic in terms of code.
- HTTP and other requests are made in the blinds.
-If a page is intended to be referenced on Google, the css must be in the style tag and not in the classes of the template part, in order to improve SEO.
-for a page not intended to be referenced, use tailwind in the classes in the template section
